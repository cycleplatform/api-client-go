    The Cycle API is a [REST-based](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), resource-oriented API
    designed to be easy to use and understand. Using this API, you are able to fully interact with the Cycle Platform. 

    All API responses return JSON, including errors. There is also support for cross-origin resource sharing, so this API can be used
    in a client-side web application as well.

    ## Auth Basics 
    Every API request much have an accompanying API key in the Authorization header. For more informaiton on generating an API key head over to the [Portal Docs](https://docs.cycle.io/docs/hubs/API-access/api-key-generate). 

    Your API key should never be made publicly available, published to a public repository, or used on a client side
    web app. If you would like to use the API from a web app, you should create a thin-client service that acts as a passthrough for
    your API requests.

    ## The Root Document
    Every response follows the same structure, known as the root document. The main data structure, known as a
    resource, is nested under a data field. If you request a collection of resources, the
    data field will be an array of those resources. If you request a single resource, the data field will be
    equal to that resource.

    If there is an error, the error field will be present, and the data field will be present and null.

    The root resource. If fetching a collection, this will be an array of resource objects.

    Includes fields - the key will be the name of the included item passed. All values of include fields
    will be a full resource structure. (i.e. including environments will embed full environment objects by ID)

    Meta Fields - the key will be equal to the name of the meta field provided. Values of meta
    fields will vary based on the resource. These values are injected into the data object(s).

    ## Scope
    In order to fetch resources that are part of a hub (containers, environments, etc.), you will need to pass an
    X-Hub-ID header. When fetching collections of resources, this will limit the response to contain only resources from
    the specified hub. Most requests require this header.

    ## Queries
    When trying to gather more complete or specific data you can use query paramaters to supplement the normal return (metas,
    includes) and you can also add specificity to the format and the order (sort, filter). It's worth understanding that
    sort & filter should only be used on collections.

    **Sort** - An array of sort values. To sort descending, put a `-`n front of the value, i.e. `-id`.

    **Include** - An array of include values. Included resources will show up under the root document's `include` field, with the key being the id
    of the included resource. In the case of applying an include to a collection of resources, if two resources share the same
    include, it will only appear once in the return.

    **Meta** - An array of meta values. Meta values will show up under a resource's `meta` field. In the case of applying a meta to a
    collection of resources, each resource will have it's own relevant meta data. In some rare cases, meta may not apply to
    individual resources, and may appear in the root document. These will be clearly labeled.

    **Filter** - The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.

    description: Environments are logical groupings of containers. All containers deployed inside an environment automatically have a private network built between them, enabling seamless communication.
  - name: Containers
    description: Containers are a way to package together your application along with it's dependencies, and run in a resource isolated process. They provide consistency across different hosts, efficiency over traditional hosting methods, and facilitate a micro-service based approach, where each logical piece of your application is split into multiple, easily testable parts (such as API, Backend, Frontend, etc).

            ## Possible Values
            ### Search 
            `filter[search]=value` search for a value associated with a field on the given environment(s).

            ### State
            `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the environment's current state.

            ### Stack Build
            `filter[stack_build]=ID` stack build filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the stack build you wish to filter for and the return sill be any environments that have the stack build deployed to them.

            ## Filter Field
            The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.

            ## Possible Values
            ### Search
            `filter[search]=value` search containers for a value associated with a field on the given container(s).

            ### State
            `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the container's current state.

            ### Service
            `filter[service]=value` service filtering will allow you to filter by service type: `loadbalancer`, `discovery`, `vpn`.

            ### Public Network
            `filter[public_network]=value` public network filtering will allow you to filter by the containers network settings: `enabled`, `disabled`, `egress-only`.

            ### Image 
            `filter[image]=ID` image filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the image you wish to filter for and the return will be any containers currently using the image.

            ### Environment
            `filter[environment]=ID` environment filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the environment you wish to filter for and the return will be any containers in that environment.

            ### Tags
            `filter[tags]=tagone,tagtwo,tagthree` container filtering using server tags. If the container has the tags you submit it will be part of the return. 

            ### Stacks
            `filter[stack]=ID` stack filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the stack you wish to filter for and the return will be any containers deployed associated with 'containers' from the stack.

            ## Possible Values
            ### State
            `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the instance's current state.

            ### Search 
            `filter[search]=value` search instances for a value associated with a field on the given instance(s).

            ### Server
            `filter[server]=ID` server filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the server you wish to filter for and the return will be any instances of the container currently deployed to the given server.

            ## Filter Field
            The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.

            ## Possible Values
            ### Search
            `filter[search]=value` search activities for a value associated with a field on the given activity(s).

            ### State
            `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the activity's current state.

            ### User 
            `filter[user]=ID` user filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the user you wish to filter for and the return will be any activity from that user.

            ### Environment
            `filter[environment]=ID` environment filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the environment you wish to filter for and the return will be any activity from that environment.

            ### container
            `filter[container]=ID` container filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the container you wish to filter for and the return will be any activity from that container.

            ### Instance
            `filter[instance]=ID` instance filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the instance you wish to filter for and the return will be any activity from that instance.

            ### Server
            `filter[server]=ID` server filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the server you wish to filter for and the return will be any activity from that server.

            ### Event
            `filter[event]=value` filter by event occurrence. Example: `filter[event]=environment.services.vpn.login`

            ### Verbosity
            `filter[verbosity]=integer` filter the activity return by verbosity. The verbosity can be:

              `0` - Activity that users would find useful.
              `1` - Activity that can be useful when tracking down how something happened. 
              `2` - Full activity, can be useful in debugging problems.

            The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.

            ## Possible Values
            ### Search 
            `filter[search]=value` search for a value associated with a field on the given image(s).

            ### State
            `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the image's current state.

            ### Source Type
            `filter[source_type]=value` filter images by the image source's type.  Can be: `direct` or `stack_build`

            ### Source
            `filter[source_id]=ID` image filtering by source ID.  Submit the ID of the image source you wish to filter for and the return will be any images created from that source.

            ## Filter Field 
            The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.

            ## Possible Values
            ### Range 
            `filter[range-start]=timestamp&filter[range-end]=timestamp` filter by range giving two times a `start` time and an `end` time. Date format `2023-03-07T14:55:17-08:00`.

            ### Search
            `filter[search]=value` search jobs for a value associated with a field on the given job(s).

            ### State
            `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the job's current state.

            ## Filter Field
            The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.

            ## Possible Values
            ### Search
            `filter[search]=value` search stack builds for a value associated with a field on the given stack build(s).

            ### State
            `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the stack build's current state.

            ## Filter Field
            The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.

            ## Possible Values
            ### Search
            `filter[search]=value` search pipelines for a value associated with a field on the given pipeline(s).

            ### State
            `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the pipeline's current state.

        The Cycle API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate a request that failed due to input, and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error on Cycle's part (rare).
        There are two types of error response objects. Errors with authentication are formatted to follow the OAuth spec, while all other errors follow the same convention. If you're using one of our API Libraries, they will standardize OAuth errors to fit the general convention.
